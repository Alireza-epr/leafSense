NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a value between -1 and +1 that shows how healthy and green the vegetation is.
	High NDVI → healthy and green plants
	Medium NDVI → normal or growing vegetation
	Low NDVI → dry plants, weak vegetation, or bare soil
	It is calculated using the light that plants reflect — mainly red and near-infrared (NIR) light — captured by satellites.

	NIR (Near Infrared) → Plants reflect a lot of NIR light when they are healthy. ( Higher NIR > healthier )
	Red → Plants absorb most red light for photosynthesis, so healthy plants reflect less red light. (Less Red > healthier)
	NDVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red)​
	
	NDVI gives a high positive value (close to +1) if NIR is high,Red is low > vegetation is healthy
	NDVI is near 0 if both NIR and Red are similar > there’s no vegetation or dry/bare soil
	NDVI can be negative if Red is high,NIR is low > water or cloud  
	
	NDVI Quality:
		Good quality: Clean, clear data with no cloud issues — safe to use for decisions
		Medium quality:	Some noise or cloud, acceptable but not perfect
		Poor quality: Cloudy, low accuracy, cannot trust the result
	
		depends on factors like:
			-How clear the satellite image is (clouds, fog, atmosphere)
			-How good the satellite sensor is
			-Whether the NDVI was processed or raw

Sensor: 
 Sentinel-2 L2A
 Landsat 8/9 (USGS/NASA)
 MODIS (NASA Terra/Aqua)
 PlanetScope (Planet Labs)

Cloud Strategy 
	clouds can block the view of the land and vegetation, so NDVI or other indices can be incorrect
	A cloud strategy is how you plan to handle or remove cloudy pixels from your data to get accurate results.
	
	OPTIONS:
		A)Quality Assurance (QA) layer:
			The satellite’s built-in QA Layer already tells you which pixels are cloudy, shadowed, or clear.
			For NDVI clear vegetation, select pixels marked as clear.
			Examples: Scene classification layer (labels pixels as cloud, vegetation, water, etc.) or Cloud mask layer
			Advantage: 
				-More accurate (Built using satellite’s internal algorithms, better than guessing clouds manually.)
				-fast (Ready to use with your NDVI calculation), 
				-easier to implement (No need to analyze raw bands to detect clouds).
			Example workflow:
				Load Sentinel-2 image
				Load its QA layer
				Mask all cloudy or shadowed pixels
				Calculate NDVI only on the remaining clear pixels
		B)Simple Band Thresholds + Morphological Clean-up:
			Use thresholds on certain bands (like B2, B3, B4, or B8) to detect clouds.
			Apply morphological operations using image processing techniques (like removing small noisy areas) to clean the mask.
			Advantage: Works anywhere, independent of QA layer and can tune thresholds
			Disadvantage: Less precise, more manual work and requires trial-and-error
			Example workflow:
				Find pixels that are bright → likely clouds
				Remove small mistakes → smooth the mask
				Ignore clouds and calculate NDVI

AOI
	The bounding box is just the coordinates of the corners of that rectangle.
	lat: latitude   عرض جغرافیایی
	lon: longitude  طول جغرافیایی
	(max_lat, min_lon)    (max_lat, max_lon)
        +----------------+
        |                |
        |     AOI        |
        |                |
        +----------------+
	(min_lat, min_lon)    (min_lat, max_lon)
	
	- Draw a polygon around your AOI in Google Earth.
	- Save the project or polygon.
	- Copy feature
	- Paste the KML file in a text editor.
	- Use Coordinates tag: 
		min_lon: smallest longitude value (first number in each coordinate)
		min_lat: smallest latitude value (second number in each coordinate)
		max_lon: largest longitude value (first number in each coordinate)
		max_lat: largest latitude value (second number in each coordinate)

STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) 
	It’s a standard way to access satellite imagery and other geospatial data over the web.
	A public STAC API lets you:
		- Search for satellite images online
		- Filter by area, date, cloud cover, or other properties
		- Get links to download the images or use them in your app
		
	a)Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem STAC API
		Collections for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat, etc. Supports bbox, datetime, cloudCover filters.
		Endpoints: 
			/search
			/api
			/queryables
			/collections
			/conformance
		Extensions:
			collections
			filter
			query
			fields
			sort
						
	b)Sentinel Hub Catalog API
		Supports STAC-style search (POST/JSON) with bbox, datetime, collections, eo:cloud_cover etc.
		Needs an account.
	c)Earth Search — Element 84 STAC API
		Supports bbox, datetime, cloud_cover.lte, collections filters.
	
	Key query params:
		-bbox: [min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat]

Projection: How coordinates are represented on a map. 
	1. Web Mercator (EPSG:3857)
		This is a projection for displaying maps on the web.
		Coordinates are shown in degrees of latitude and longitude.
		Feature: Fast for loading and zooming maps, but distorts areas near the poles.
		Use: Only for visualizing maps in a browser or web app.
		Works with tiles, so zooming and panning are fast.
			- Tiles are small square pieces of a large map or satellite image.
				Without tiles → the browser tries to load a huge image → very slow.
				With tiles → the image is cut into 256×256 px squares → only visible squares are loaded → fast.
		Example:
			If we have a map of Iran in Web Mercator, you can see Tehran and Shiraz correctly, but Greenland will appear much larger than it really is.

	2. UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
		This is also a projection that converts the curved Earth onto a flat map.
		Coordinates are in meters (Easting/Northing).
		Feature: Accurate for calculating area, distance, and NDVI, with minimal distortion within each zone.
		Use: For satellite data analysis and real-world calculations.
		Example:
			If we have a farm in Shiraz and measure its area using UTM coordinates, we get the true area in square meters, unlike Web Mercator, which is only for display.

“Time series response” refers to how quickly the app can show the data for a selected area over time.

CWV stands for Cloud Water Vapor
CWV “good” is just saying: “Only use data when cloud conditions are acceptable for accurate plant monitoring.”
