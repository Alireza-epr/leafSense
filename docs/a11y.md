# Accessibility (A11y) Guidelines

This document lists accessibility checks and known limitations for the project components.

---

## General Checks

- All interactive elements are keyboard-focusable (`tabIndex=0` or `<button>`).  
- Buttons, toggles, and div-based controls have `role="button"`.  
- Active/toggle states use `aria-pressed`.  
- Disabled elements use `aria-disabled` and `tabIndex=-1`.  
- Labels provided via `aria-label` or visible text.  
- Icons that are decorative: `alt=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`.  
- Sliders (`<input type="range">`) use `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuetext`.  
- Sections/collapsible panels use `role="button"` + `aria-expanded`, and content uses `role="region"` with `aria-hidden` when collapsed.  
- Lists use `role="list"` and items use `role="listitem"`.  

## Keyboard Flow

- Focus moves **from Sidebar** to chart or interactive component.  
- Focus is **trapped within chart modal** while open.  
- **Escape key closes the modal**.  
- Focus **returns to Sidebar trigger** after closing the modal.  
- Complex flows in progress

## Known Limitations

- Decorative icons with `alt=""` do **not show fallback text** if images fail to load.  
- Screen reader support for custom sliders may vary; native `<input type="range">` recommended.  
- MapLibre and Recharts have **internal ARIA labels**; additional labeling may be needed for full context.  
- Dynamic focus management (e.g., `isFocused`) must be tested for all keyboard flows.  
- Complex chart flows (markers, dynamic content) are partially implemented.  
- current limitation in keyboard flow: **map marker handling** is not fully keyboard accessible.
